This is a website I made to learn HTML from the Odin Project. I started with React, having no prior experience with JS, CSS, or HTML. I was just coasting through it, understanding nothing; that was when I came across the Odin Project's Foundations course. At first, I was thinking, teach me React, what is this primitive non-sense, but after watching some YouTube videos regarding "vibe coding" and the uselessness of the upcoming junior devs, I realized maybe having a strong grasp of HTML, CSS, and JS will do me some good. 

I think with the functionality of AI, its looked down on you to be putting out the sort of stuff I have been uploading to my GitHub. Chat GPT could make an infinitely better site in a second, but will it be able to solve bugs that fast, can it even understand visual bugs? I have realized the more complex and zoomed in a problem gets, the more useless Ghat GPT gets. Therefore I think its crucial to have a solid understanding of good practises, then maybe use AI to go fast, but starting on it kind of teaches you nothing, and my goal right now is to learn!

TL;DR Check out two recipes on my AMAZING SITE!!!
